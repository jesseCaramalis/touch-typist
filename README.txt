# Touch Typist
Simple webapp for practicing touch typing, intended for deployment on a Rasberry Pi running Node.js and for use in classrooms.
Made with minimal distractions and barebones functionality to ensure low maintenance and accessibility for students.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, backend built with Node.js, Express.

Modern typing applications are filled with distractions, advertisements and excessive gamification. Additionally, in an age of touch screens and mobile sized keyboards, fullsize keyboard touch typing is a skill that students today are not effectively learning.
Teachers have expressed interest in a simple handheld keyboard/screen combo that can be used by young students to practice touch typing.
Touch Typist is built using JavaScript, utilising libraries with thousands of words that are efficiently pulled with minimal load times.
The end result is a fast and scalable webapp that focuses on the basics; teaching kids how to touch type.

## Optimizations
Deployment onto a Raspberry Pi server running Node.js is the next step for this project. 
Additional functionalities to build include a words per minute feature, text to speech, localStorage scoring, and better visual feedback for correctly typing the word.
OOP principles and general redundant code removal is planned before fullstack integration.

## Lessons Learned:
I started this project when I had just started learning JS and programming in general. While simple, it reflects the need for fewer overcomplicated solutions in the world.  It’s been fun growing it and I’m excited to push it into a physical application that will benefit real people.
